# great_powers
Here at Hyland a few of us opted to play the board game "Diplomacy" during our breaks. Word spread, and as the game became more popular around campus, the need arose to assign great powers to players on multiple boards. We were resorting to drawing names written on post it notes out of paper cups. This python script aquires the names of all players and then assigns them to great powers across multiple boards.
